# 👋 Hi, I'm Niels

## 🌱 Personal Builds
- **AI-first Smart Home** → presence detection, dashboards, local AI servers

- Trying to integrate an AI powered smart home setup with my retro futurism / space age interior design




## 🛠️ Tech I Use
Python · React · Streamlit · Swift · Docker · SQLite · UniFi · Home Assistant · Ollama · MCP servers  



## ✨ Outside of Code
Exploring aviation, fitness, plants and interior design
